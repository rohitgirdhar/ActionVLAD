This code is based on TensorFlow/models repository
(https://github.com/tensorflow/models) which is released on Apache 2.0 license
(license included in `LICENSE-tensorflow-models` file). We made various changes
to the original code base to make it amenable to work with video input data,
and wrote various new deep network layers (most notably ActionVLAD).
